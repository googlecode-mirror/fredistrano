# Corporate intranet websites #

We have been using fredistrano for more than two years to deploy PHP intranet sites. Actually, the first serious release of Fredsitrano (0.3.X) helped us a lot for the automation of the deployment process.  Moreover, based on the log entries generated by each deployment, we were able to follow exactly which was pushed to production at what time and by whom.

However, we always had to fight against performance issues. When an application had many files, the finalization step that changes permissions was really slow. Version 1.0 tackles these performance issues.

# Dreamhost #

Fredistrano is also used to deploy PHP sites on the Web Hosting provider Dreamhost.
