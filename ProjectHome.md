## Description ##
**Fredistrano** is a deployment tool for web applications. It automates the export of your sources from a subversion repository and synchronizes them with the content of a target directory. Several manual tasks are also handled directly by the application during the deployment: renaming of configuration files, modifying permissions... **Fredistrano** is inspired from the smart [Capistrano](http://www.capify.org/) project.

From a technical perspective, this application has been written in PHP with the [cakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org/) framework. **Fredistrano** both supports Windows/Linux environment. Concerning Windows, **Fredistrano** requires the installation of [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) in order to use the _rsync_ command.
